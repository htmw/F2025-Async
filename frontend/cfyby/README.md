# CFYBY Frontend

"Curated For You By You"

This project is the frontend for the CFYBY application, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Setup

To get the development environment running:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173/`.

3.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command builds the application for production in the `dist` folder.

4.  **Lint the code:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    This runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
